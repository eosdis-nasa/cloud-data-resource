# EOSDIS Cloud Data Resource

Welcome to the EOSDIS Cloud Data Resource page! This document serves to act as a guide and resource to users working in the cloud. 
This page is meant to serve as an amalgamation of NASA's resources for using data from and in the cloud. This includes sources from NASA, NASA partners and other affiliates. 

### Why Use the Cloud?
NASA EOSDIS is evolving to use a commercial cloud to ingest, archive, process, distribute, and manage the anticipated large volumes of new mission data. Placing the EOSDIS archive collectively in the cloud will, for the first time, place NASA Earth Observing data “close to compute” and improve management and accessibility of these data while also expediting science discovery for data users. Having EOSDIS data in the cloud will not change the existing user experience of interacting with these data, but it will offer new methods of access not otherwise possible with on-premises platforms.



### Earthdata Cloud Primer for Amazon Web Services
The [Cloud Primer](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/webinars-and-tutorials/cloud-primer-amazon-web-services)* is a series of tutorial PDFs to help walk a user through the steps needed to do analysis in the cloud. The Primer focuses on doing so through AWS (via [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)) as our data archives are stored in AWS. Users can take best advantage of data speeds and compute resources by using these Amazon services which "sit" directly next to the data. 

The tutorial is broken up into 9 parts: 
[01 — Why Use the Cloud?](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/imported/01_Why_Use_the_Cloud.pdf)
[02 — Understanding and Managing Costs in the AWS Cloud](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/imported/02_Understanding_and_Managing_Costs_in_the_AWS_Cloud.pdf)
[03 — Create a Basic Elastic Cloud Computer (EC2) Instance](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/imported/03_Create_a_Basic_Elastic_Cloud_Compute__EC2__Instance.pdf)
[04 — Connect to an AWS EC2 Instance - Windows and PuTTY](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/imported/04_Connect_to_an_AWS_EC2_Instance_-_Windows_and_PuTTY.pdf)
