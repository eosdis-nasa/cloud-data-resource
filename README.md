# EOSDIS Cloud Data Resource

Welcome to the EOSDIS Cloud Data Resource page! This document serves to act as a guide and resource to users working in the cloud. 
This page is meant to serve as an amalgamation of NASA's resources for using data from and in the cloud. This includes sources from NASA, NASA partners and other affiliates. 

### Why Use the Cloud?
NASA EOSDIS is evolving to use a commercial cloud to ingest, archive, process, distribute, and manage the anticipated large volumes of new mission data. Placing the EOSDIS archive collectively in the cloud will, for the first time, place NASA Earth Observing data “close to compute” and improve management and accessibility of these data while also expediting science discovery for data users. Having EOSDIS data in the cloud will not change the existing user experience of interacting with these data, but it will offer new methods of access not otherwise possible with on-premises platforms.
